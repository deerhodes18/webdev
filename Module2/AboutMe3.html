      <p>I love watching movies and tv shows. I don't only watch it for the entertainment aspect though. I consume it as if it were literature. Films can be thought as a moving novel. In fact, when you are watching a movie made from a book, you are watching the director's interpretation of that book. I would agree with the argument that books are often better than their cinematic counterparts. I, however, think it is part of the fun to see what another person envisioned when they read the book. I see movies and tv as art. It is mostly entertainment but I do appreciate the effort, and skill that went into the work. I take not of the techniques that are used and the talent of the actors. I pay attention to this especially for anime. Anime is very artistic as it is purely animation pulled away from hand drawn images. Some of my favorite cinematic masterpieces are A clockwork Orange, Pulp Fiction, and Star Wars.</p>
