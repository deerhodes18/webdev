          <section><p> My name is Diavonte Rhodes. I am a pretty reserved person when it comes to cerain situations. I wouldn't consider myself to be a social shark, but I loosen up once I get comfortable with the setting and the people around me. I like to meet new people and experience different things but my social anxiety tends to get in the way of that. Sometimes I am awkward because I am not used to being in social settings and being "put on the spot". I can have a conversation with someon if it is just me and them but I am terrible in groups. Due to past expeirences, I tend to feel like my thoughts don't matter and that I am a placeholder instead of an active member of the party. One day, I hope to get over this fear of judgement so that I can be a step forward in enjoying life. Being socially challenged has yielded good things though. I enjoy who I am as a person. I realize that I am different and I think that makes for a pretty interesting person. I would say that the things that I am interested in came about by being socially awkward. Let me tell you what I mean. My hobbies are things that everyone enjoys, but I enjoy them differently comopared to most of the populous. A few examples of things that I enjoy differently are workingout, listening to music, and consuming media whenever I am not at school or work.</p></section>
