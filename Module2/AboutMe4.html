    <section><p>When I was younger, I was always a fat and chubby kid. Like all kids like this, I was often picked on. My weight seemed to get in the way of things like finding a girlfriend and finding friends. Those experiences have made me into the person I am today. Though I hate how I was treated in the past, it pushed me to get into fitness and building my body. The knowledge I gain and seeing my progress is what drives me to continue on my journey. It is not easy though. I still suffer from the same harships, except most of it comes from myself. It is not hard for me to turn to pessemistic thoughts whenever I think of scary questions like "Will it get better?" or "Will I ever be loved"? It is moments like these that start to make me depressed and the gym is my escape from that. I can take all of my frustrations out in the gym. Lifting heavy weights and feeling the pain clears my head and helps me focus on all of the good things I have going for me and my accomplishments. The gym won't hurt me like the rest of the world will, therefore; I use it to my advantage in order to keep my mental health in check as well as my phsycial health.</p></section></body>
