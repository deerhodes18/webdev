          <section><p>Music is another outlet for me. During high school, I was a bit different from everyone else. I always had different preferences than everybody. I was practically raised on hip hop and r&b but then I started to branch out once I got into highschool. It wwas then that I discovered pop music and fell in love with it immediately. A few years later, I was introduced to metal when I first heard Metallica. Just like with pop, I instantly fell in love with the genre and started looking up different bands and watching their live performances. Oh how I wish i could have gone to a few of them. My music tastes also extends to jazz and music by international artists. I discovered most of the songs stemming from that through media.</p></section>
